## PDK include generator

This folder includes a small python script that takes a csv file with register descriptions and generates header files with register mapping for SDCC.

 - **genioincludes**  - the script  
 - **output/**  - contains output data
 - **PDK_register_map.csv** - the input file

The csv input file is a slightly modifed version of the file compiled and posted by JS [here](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/blog/eevblog-1144-padauk-programmer-reverse-engineering/msg2518545/#msg2518545).

# Analysis of programming sequence

The pdf file in this folder contains an analysis of datalogs of the programming sequence of a PMS150C and PFS154. The data was recorded by [Frank Buss](http://www.frank-buss.de) on a [fast analog sampler](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/blog/eevblog-1144-padauk-programmer-reverse-engineering/msg2017267/#msg2017267) he built for that purpose. The original data can be found [here](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/blog/eevblog-1144-padauk-programmer-reverse-engineering/msg2096917/#msg2096917 ) and [here](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/blog/eevblog-1144-padauk-programmer-reverse-engineering/msg2113471/#msg2113471
).

The purpose of this analysis is to allow a [clean-room implemention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) of the Padauk programming protocol based on behavioral analysis, without having to revert to software reverse engineering. 

Another, prior, analysis of the PFS154 protocol by js_12345678_55aa, socram and others can be found [here](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/blog/eevblog-1144-padauk-programmer-reverse-engineering/msg2047933/#msg2047933) and following.

# Blinky PFS154 for SDCC

To be compiled on Philips branch of SDCC for the PDK14 target. 

See [here](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/461002#5643846). Please note that his branch is work in progress and not yet ready to be released. At the time of writing this, it is still neccessary to modify the generated hexfile manually to fix some instruction encodings.
